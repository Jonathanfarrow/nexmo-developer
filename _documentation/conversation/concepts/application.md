# Application

Once you have created a Nexmo Account you will be able to create multiple Nexmo Applications. Each Nexmo Application is identified by a unique Application ID.

A Nexmo Application can contain a unique set of [Users](/conversation/concepts/user) and [Conversations](/conversation/concepts/conversation).

This container hierachy is illustrated in the following diagram:

Notice that the set of Conversations and Users is unique to the Application, so there can be no conflicts.
